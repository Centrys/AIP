## Summary

Th required functionality is a way for a smart contract to validate that a message is signed by a known public address

## Value Proposition

To enable the security of messages necessary for more complex dApps that need to validate the original signature entity of the message transferred.
Enables trust less third parties that can check that the message was unaltered before it got to the dApp is question.

## Motivation

The primary motivation for the proposal is to provide the dApp's that are building on the Aion blockchain with a way to check the originator of the message and the signature entity

## Non-Goals

The scope of this standard is limited to on-chain dApp functionality

## Success Metrics

1) Number of contract deployments that take advantage of the edVerify functionality

## Description

Edverify function will be a precompiled smart contract that will allow recovering the address that signed a certain message

### High-Level Architecture

N/A

## Specification

### Definitions

### Method

A `public` function must be implemented.

**`edverify` function**

Returns the address of the account that signed the message if the message was signed with the public key of the account sent as a parameter.

> **parameters**  
> hash: bytes32 keccak 256 hashed message \
> public_key: bytes32 public key of the ED25519 key pair used to sign the message \
> signature = 64 bytes of the ED25519 signature  
> **returns:** byte array of length 32 containing: the address of the account that signed the message if the message was signed with the public key of the account sent as a parameter.

``` solidity
    function edverify(bytes32 hash, bytes32 public_key, bytes signature) public returns (bytes32);
```

## Logic


### Cross Chain Functionality

No cross chain function's involved for this AIP.
